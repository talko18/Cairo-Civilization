## Eureka & Inspiration (Boost System)

Every technology and civic has a **boost condition** that, when fulfilled, completes
**50% of the research cost** instantly (40% on Deity difficulty).

### How Boosts Work
- Displayed on the tech/civic info panel as a goal
- Can be triggered at any time (even before starting research)
- Only applies once per tech/civic
- Saves significant research time over a full game

## Tech/Civic Overflow

- If a technology completes and you have excess Science, the overflow carries to the next tech
- Same applies for Civics with excess Culture
- This makes high yield output more efficient over time
