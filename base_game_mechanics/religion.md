# Religion

Religion is a major game system in Civilization VI, enabling a unique victory condition
and providing powerful bonuses to civilizations that invest in it.

## Founding a Religion

### Step 1: Earn a Pantheon (25 Faith)
- The first 25 Faith accumulated earns a **Pantheon** selection
- Pantheons provide a passive bonus to all current and future cities
- Each pantheon can only be chosen by one player

### Step 2: Earn a Great Prophet
- Great Prophet points come from:
  - Holy Site district (+1 per turn base)
  - Shrine (+1 per turn)
  - Temple (+1 per turn)
  - Stonehenge wonder (free Great Prophet)
  - Policy cards and other bonuses
- Only a limited number of Great Prophets exist per game (usually number of players + 1, max 4-7)
- **Arabia** automatically gets the last Great Prophet if they haven't already earned one

### Step 3: Found the Religion
- Use the Great Prophet at a Holy Site or Stonehenge
- Choose a religion name and icon
- Select a **Founder Belief** and **Follower Belief**

### Step 4: Enhance the Religion (via Apostle)
- Use an Apostle's "Launch Inquisition" or "Evangelize Belief" ability
- Add an **Enhancer Belief** and/or **Worship Building Belief**
- Each religion can have up to 4 beliefs total

## Spreading Religion

### Natural Spread
- Cities exert **Religious Pressure** within 10 tiles
- Pressure strength depends on the number of followers in the source city
- Holy Cities exert extra pressure

### Active Spread (Missionaries/Apostles)
- Move adjacent to a target city and use "Spread Religion" action
- Converts a portion of the city's population to your religion
- More effective in cities with little/no existing religion
- Apostles are stronger spreaders than Missionaries

### Through Combat
- When a religious unit is killed in **theological combat**, nearby cities gain pressure
  from the winner's religion and lose pressure from the loser's religion
- When killed in **regular combat** (Condemn Heretic), only the dead unit's religion
  loses pressure

## Theological Combat

- Only **Apostles** can initiate theological combat
- Works like regular combat using **Religious Strength** instead of Combat Strength
- Default Religious Strength: 110 for Apostles, 100 for Missionaries, 75 for Inquisitors
- Same damage formula as regular combat
- Losing unit is destroyed; winning unit survives with damage
- Nearby cities are affected by religious pressure changes
- **Inquisitors** provide +5 RS bonus when fighting in friendly territory

## Religious Victory

To win a Religious Victory:
- Your religion must be the **predominant religion** (followed by >50% of cities) in
  **every civilization** still in the game
- A city follows your religion when the majority of its citizens are followers
- Strategy: Focus on Apostles for converting religious cities, Missionaries for unreligious ones
- Consider military support to protect religious units
- Alternative: Conquer and raze cities of other religions to change the denominator

### Important Rules
- Other civs may declare **Holy Wars** against you
- AI civilizations will actively try to convert cities back
