# Civilizations & Leaders (Base Game)

Each civilization in Civ6 has unique components: a civilization ability, a unique unit,
a unique piece of infrastructure, and each leader has a distinct leader ability and agenda.

## Civilization Components

Every civilization has:
1. **Civilization Ability** - A passive bonus affecting gameplay throughout the game
2. **Unique Unit** - A special military unit replacing a standard one (stronger or different abilities)
3. **Unique Infrastructure** - A unique building, district, or tile improvement
4. **Leader** - A leader with their own ability and agenda
