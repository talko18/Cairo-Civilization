- Each Commercial Hub or Harbor grants **+1 Trade Route capacity**
- Certain wonders and policies also grant additional capacity
- Traders have limited range (extended by Trading Posts and certain abilities)

### Domestic Trade Routes
Provide **Food and Production** to the origin city:

| Destination Has | Yield to Origin |

### Trading Posts

- All future Trade Routes passing through earn **+1 Gold** per Trading Post

### Roads
- Trade Routes **automatically build Roads** along their path
- Road quality improves with era:

| Era | Road Type | Movement Cost |
|-----|-----------|---------------|
| Ancient | Ancient Road | 1 MP per tile |
| Classical | Classical Road | 0.75 MP per tile (approximately) |

| Suzerainty of certain city-states | Bonus yields |

### Plundering Trade Routes

- Trade Routes are canceled (not plundered) when war is declared
