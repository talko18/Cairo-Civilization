# Civilization VI - Game Overview

## Genre & Structure

Civilization VI is a **turn-based strategy** and **4X** (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate) game.
Players lead a civilization from the Ancient Era through the Future Era, competing against
other civilizations (AI or human) to achieve one of several victory conditions.

## Core Game Loop

Each turn, the player:
1. Manages cities (production queues, citizen assignment, purchasing)
2. Moves military, civilian, and religious units
3. Conducts diplomacy with other civilizations and city-states
4. Monitors research progress (technologies and civics)
5. Responds to events (barbarian attacks, natural disasters, diplomatic proposals)

## Map

- The game world is a **hex-based map** with various terrain types
- Maps can be generated procedurally or use pre-set configurations
- Map types include: Continents, Pangaea, Archipelago, Island Plates, and more
- Map sizes: Duel (2 players), Tiny (3), Small (4), Standard (6), Large (8), Huge (10+)

## Game Speeds

| Speed | Turn Count (Standard Game) | Research/Production Multiplier |
|-------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Online | ~250 turns | 50% of Standard |
| Quick | ~330 turns | 67% of Standard |
| Standard | ~500 turns | 100% (baseline) |

## Difficulty Levels

| Level | Name | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| 1 | Settler | AI has penalties; player has bonuses |
| 2 | Chieftain | Slight AI penalties |
| 3 | Warlord | Balanced for beginners |
| 4 | Prince | No bonuses for either side (fair) |
| 5 | King | AI gets minor bonuses |
| 6 | Emperor | AI gets significant bonuses |
| 7 | Immortal | AI gets major bonuses |
| 8 | Deity | AI gets extreme bonuses (extra Settlers, Builders, Warriors, Combat Strength) |

Higher difficulties give the AI:
- Free starting units (extra Warriors, Settlers, Builders)
- Bonus Combat Strength for military units
- Reduced research and production costs
- Bonus Gold, Faith, Culture, Science per turn
- Reduced Eureka/Inspiration bonuses for the player (40% instead of 50% on Deity)

## Yields (Core Resources)

The six primary yields drive the game:

| Yield | Icon Color | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Food | Green | City population growth |
| Production | Orange | Building units, buildings, districts, wonders |
| Gold | Yellow | Universal currency for purchasing and maintenance |
| Science | Blue | Researching technologies |
| Culture | Purple | Researching civics, expanding borders, generating Tourism |
| Faith | White | Religious units, special purchases |

## Expansions & DLC

- **Base Game** (October 2016)

## One Unit Per Tile (1UPT)

The fundamental tactical rule:
- Only **one military unit** per tile
- Only **one civilian unit** per tile (Settler, Builder, Trader, etc.)
- Only **one support unit** per tile (Battering Ram, Medic, etc.)
- Religious units exist on a **separate layer**
- Military + civilian + support can coexist on the same tile via escort formations
