# Governments & Policy Cards

Governments define a civilization's political structure and provide policy card slots
for customization. Both are unlocked through the Civics tree.

## Government Structure

Each government has:
- **Inherent Bonus:** A permanent effect while using this government
- **Policy Card Slots:** A specific combination of Military, Economic, Diplomatic, and Wildcard slots
- **Legacy Bonus:** Accumulates over time spent in this government (+1 bonus per certain number of turns)

Changing governments costs no Gold when unlocking a new civic; otherwise it costs
a scaling amount of Gold based on how many policy slots you have.
