# Great People

Great People in Civilization VI are unique historical figures with individual abilities.
Unlike previous games, each Great Person has a distinct bonus rather than generic effects.

| Great Admiral | Harbor | Harbor, Shipyard, Seaport |
| Great Scientist | Campus | Campus, Library, University, Research Lab |

| Great Artist | Theater Square | Art Museum |
| Great Musician | Theater Square | Broadcast Center |

## Earning Great People

### Great Person Points (GPP)
- Each relevant district and its buildings generate GPP per turn
- Policy cards can boost GPP generation
- Certain wonders provide GPP
- City-state bonuses can provide GPP

### Competition System
- All civilizations compete for the same pool of Great People
- Each Great Person has a specific GPP cost
- The first civilization to accumulate enough points claims that Great Person
- If you don't want the current Great Person, you can **pass** and wait for the next one
- You can also **patronize** (purchase) a Great Person with Gold or Faith

### Patronage Costs
- Cost varies based on how many GPP you've already accumulated
- Can use Gold (always available) or Faith (with certain governments/buildings)

## Great Person Abilities

### Great Generals
- **Passive:** +5 Combat Strength and +1 Movement to land units within 2 tiles
- **Retire:** Various effects depending on the individual (e.g., grant XP, create a unique improvement)
- Only one Great General can be active at a time (passive effect)
- Passive bonus is era-limited (a Classical Great General doesn't boost Modern units)
