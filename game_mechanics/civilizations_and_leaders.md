# Civilizations & Leaders

Each civilization in Civ6 has unique components: a civilization ability, a unique unit,
a unique piece of infrastructure, and each leader has a distinct leader ability and agenda.

## Civilization Components

Every civilization has:
1. **Civilization Ability** - A passive bonus affecting gameplay throughout the game
2. **Unique Unit** - A special military unit replacing a standard one (stronger or different abilities)
3. **Unique Infrastructure** - A unique building, district, or tile improvement
4. **Leader(s)** - One or more leaders, each with their own ability and agenda

## Unique Unit Upgrades

Unique units generally replace a standard unit in the tech tree:
- They inherit the promotions of the unit they upgrade from
- They upgrade into the next standard unit in the line (e.g., Eagle Warrior -> Swordsman)
- Unique units typically have higher CS, special abilities, or lower cost than their standard counterpart

## Multiple Leaders Per Civilization

Some civilizations have multiple leaders (added via DLC/expansions):
- **China:** Qin Shi Huang (Mandate of Heaven), Qin Shi Huang (Unifier), Kublai Khan, Yongle, Wu Zetian
- **India:** Gandhi, Chandragupta
- **France:** Catherine de Medici (Black Queen), Catherine de Medici (Magnificence), Eleanor of Aquitaine

Each leader shares the civilization ability but has their own unique leader ability and agenda.
