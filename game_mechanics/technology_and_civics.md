# Technology & Civics

Civilization VI features two parallel research trees: the Technology tree (researched with
Science) and the Civics tree (researched with Culture).

## Technology Tree

### Overview
- Technologies are researched using **Science** yield
- Each technology has a base cost modified by game speed
- Technologies unlock: units, buildings, improvements, districts, wonders, resources
- The tree progresses through eras (Ancient -> Classical -> Medieval -> etc.)
- Technologies may have **prerequisites** (must research earlier techs first)

### Key Technologies by Era

| Era | Key Technologies | Unlocks |
|-----|-----------------|---------|
| Ancient | Mining, Pottery, Animal Husbandry, Sailing, Astrology, Writing | Basic improvements, Holy Site, Campus |
| Classical | Iron Working, Mathematics, Engineering, Construction | Swordsman, Aqueduct, Catapult |
| Medieval | Apprenticeship, Stirrups, Gunpowder, Military Tactics | Industrial Zone, Knight, Musketman |
| Renaissance | Cartography, Printing, Square Rigging | Ocean exploration, Naval expansion |
| Industrial | Industrialization, Steam Power, Rifling | Factory, Ironclad, Infantry |
| Modern | Flight, Radio, Electricity | Aerodrome, Seaside Resort, Power |
| Atomic | Rocketry, Nuclear Fission, Computers | Spaceport, Nuclear weapons, Tourism boost |
| Information | Satellites, Nanotechnology, Robotics | Space projects, advanced units |
| Future | Future Tech (repeatable) | +5% Production toward city projects per completion |

## Civics Tree

### Overview
- Civics are researched using **Culture** yield
- Civics unlock: governments, policy cards, districts, improvements, wonders
- Each civic has a base cost modified by game speed
- Progresses through the same eras as the tech tree

### Key Civics by Era

| Era | Key Civics | Unlocks |
|-----|-----------|---------|
| Ancient | Code of Laws, Craftsmanship, Foreign Trade, Early Empire | First government (Chiefdom), basic policies, Settlers at 2 Pop |
| Classical | Political Philosophy, Drama and Poetry, Games and Recreation | Classical governments, Theater Square, Entertainment Complex |
| Medieval | Divine Right, Mercantilism, Medieval Faires | Medieval governments, various policies |
| Renaissance | Exploration, Reformed Church, Humanism | Renaissance era wonders, Naturalist |
| Industrial | Nationalism, Mobilization, Urbanization | Corps/Army formations, Neighborhood |
| Modern | Ideology, Suffrage, Conservation | Modern governments, National Parks |
| Atomic | Cold War, Professional Sports | Rock Bands, Ski Resorts |
| Information | Globalization, Social Media | Enhanced Tourism policies |
| Future | Future Civic (repeatable) | Various bonuses |

## Eureka & Inspiration (Boost System)

This is a core mechanic that rewards active gameplay. Most technologies and civics have a
specific condition that, when met, provides a **free research boost**.

### How Boosts Work
- **Eureka** (for Technologies): Provides 50% of the tech's research cost instantly
  (reduced to 40% on Deity difficulty)
- **Inspiration** (for Civics): Provides 50% of the civic's research cost instantly
  (reduced to 40% on Deity difficulty)

### Example Boosts

| Technology | Eureka Condition |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Sailing | Found a city on the Coast |
| Writing | Meet another civilization |
| Archery | Kill a unit with a Slinger |
| Iron Working | Build an Iron Mine |
| Apprenticeship | Build 3 Mines |
| Printing | Build 2 Universities |
| Rocketry | Boost a technology with a Great Scientist |

| Civic | Inspiration Condition |
|-------|----------------------|
| Code of Laws | (Auto-granted at game start) |
| Foreign Trade | Discover a second continent |
| Political Philosophy | Meet 3 city-states |
| Drama and Poetry | Build a Wonder |
| Nationalism | Declare war using a Casus Belli |
| Conservation | Build a Neighborhood |

### Strategic Implications
- Players should plan actions to trigger Eurekas/Inspirations before or while researching
- Boosts effectively halve research time when triggered
- Some civilizations have special bonuses related to boosts:
  - **China (Dynastic Cycle):** Boosts provide an extra 10% (total 60%)
  - **Babylon (Enuma Anu Enlil):** Eurekas instantly complete the technology, but -50% Science per turn

## Research Overflow

- If a technology or civic is completed mid-turn, excess research carries over to the next item
- Switching research targets wastes accumulated progress (it's retained but stops advancing)

## Future Technologies and Civics

- **Future Tech** and **Future Civic** are repeatable research items available in the Future Era
- Each completion of Future Tech provides +5% Production toward city projects (cumulative)
- Each completion provides score points
