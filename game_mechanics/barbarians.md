# Barbarians

Barbarians are hostile non-player entities that threaten all civilizations throughout
the game. They spawn from Outposts in unexplored territory and conduct raids on
nearby cities.

## Barbarian Outposts

- Spawn in **fog of war** (unexplored/unseen tiles)
- Cannot spawn within a certain radius of any city or unit
- Generate barbarian units periodically
- Destroyed when a military unit moves onto the tile (yielding 50 Gold)
- New outposts continue spawning throughout the game in unclaimed territory

## Barbarian Behavior

### Scouting Phase
1. Outpost spawns a **Scout** unit
2. Scout explores the map looking for nearby cities
3. If the Scout finds a city, it returns to the outpost (exclamation mark icon appears)
4. Once the Scout returns, the outpost begins spawning military units to raid that city

### Raiding Phase
- After a Scout reports back, the outpost spawns combat units appropriate to the era
- Units will attack nearby cities, capture civilians, and pillage improvements
- Barbarians will capture undefended **Settlers** and **Builders**
- Barbarian units scale with the game era (no more Warriors in the Industrial Era)

### Key Behaviors
- Barbarians are **always at war** with all civilizations
- They do not build cities, research technologies, or engage in diplomacy
- Barbarian units will not intentionally target religious units (but may kill them if sharing a tile)
- They can cross water once naval units become era-appropriate
- On water, barbarian Galleys/Quadriremes can threaten coastal cities and embarked units

## Barbarian Unit Types

| Era | Land Units | Naval Units |
|-----|-----------|-------------|
| Ancient | Warrior, Slinger, Spearman, Heavy Chariot | Galley |
| Classical | Swordsman, Archer, Horseman | Galley, Quadrireme |
| Medieval | Man-At-Arms, Crossbowman, Knight | Caravel |
| Renaissance | Musketman, Courser | Privateer |
| Industrial | Line Infantry, Field Cannon, Cavalry | Ironclad |
| Modern+ | Infantry, Artillery, Tank | Submarine |

## XP from Barbarians

- Combat with Barbarians grants **full XP** until a unit reaches **Level 1**
- After Level 1, all barbarian combat grants only **1 XP** regardless of circumstances
- This prevents players from "farming" barbarians for unlimited promotions

## Dealing with Barbarians

### Prevention
- Maintain **vision** over territory near your cities (barbarian outposts cannot spawn in visible tiles)
- Station Scouts or military units in strategic locations to maintain line of sight
- Build Encampment districts for additional city defense

### Elimination
- Kill the **Scout** before it returns to prevent the raiding phase
- Move a military unit onto the Outpost tile to destroy it (50 Gold reward)
- Use Slinger/Archer units to safely pick off barbarian units from range

### Rewards
| Action | Reward |
|--------|--------|
| Destroying an Outpost | 50 Gold (may vary by difficulty) |
| Killing barbarian units | XP, possible Era Score (R&F) |
| Sumeria's Epic Quest ability | Tribal Village reward when capturing Outpost |

## Difficulty Scaling

On higher difficulty levels:
- Barbarians spawn more frequently
- Barbarian units may have slight combat bonuses
- More outposts appear on the map
- Scouts are more aggressive about finding cities

## Barbarian Clans Game Mode (New Frontier Pass DLC)

When this optional game mode is enabled:
- Barbarian outposts become **named Clans** with unique identities
- Clans have a disposition meter that changes based on interactions
- Players can interact with Clans in new ways:

| Action | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Bribe | Pay Gold to prevent raids temporarily |
| Hire | Pay Gold to recruit a barbarian unit |
| Incite | Pay Gold to direct clan to attack another civilization |
| Trade | Exchange resources with the clan |

- Clans can eventually **convert into City-States** if left alone long enough
- Different clan types: Flatland, Hills, Forest, Chariot, Jungle, Cavalry, Naval
- Each type spawns units matching their specialty

## Rebels

In Rise & Fall, cities with very low Loyalty can spawn **Rebel** units:
- These function similarly to barbarians
- They belong to a "Free City" if the city flips
- Players are always at war with rebels in their territory
- Rebels do not grant meaningful XP
