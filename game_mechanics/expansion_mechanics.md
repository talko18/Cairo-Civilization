# Expansion Mechanics

The two major expansions -- Rise and Fall and Gathering Storm -- add substantial new
game systems on top of the base game.

---

## Rise and Fall (February 2018)

### Ages & Era Score

The Age system adds a cyclical evaluation of your civilization's progress.

#### How It Works
1. Throughout each era, you earn **Era Score** from accomplishing **Historic Moments**
2. At the end of each era, your Era Score is evaluated against thresholds
3. Based on your score, the next era is classified as a Dark, Normal, Golden, or Heroic Age

#### Historic Moments (Era Score Sources)

| Moment | Score | Example |
|--------|-------|---------|
| First to circumnavigate the globe | +5 | |
| Building a Wonder | +3-4 | |
| Founding a Religion | +3 | |
| Recruiting a Great Person | +1-2 | |
| Clearing a Barbarian Outpost | +1-2 | |
| Building a unique district/unit for the first time | +4 | |
| Converting a Holy City | +3 | |
| First to build a specialty district of a given type | +3 | |
| Earning a Great Person (first of that type) | +3 | |
| Establishing an alliance | +1 | |

#### Age Types

| Age | Threshold | Effects |
|-----|-----------|---------|
| Dark Age | Below threshold | -3 Loyalty per city; access to powerful but risky Dark Age policy cards; can still reach Heroic Age next era |
| Normal Age | At or above threshold | No special modifiers; standard Dedication bonuses |
| Golden Age | Well above threshold | +3 Loyalty per city; Dedication bonus with enhanced effects |
| Heroic Age | Golden threshold while coming from Dark Age | +3 Loyalty; choose 3 Dedications instead of 1 |

#### Dedications
At the start of each age, you choose a **Dedication** that provides bonuses for the era:
- **Monumentality:** +30% Faith/Gold purchases of civilian units; Builders and Settlers can be purchased with Faith
- **Pen, Brush, and Voice:** +2% Culture per specialty district; Great People points from districts doubled
- **Free Inquiry:** +100% Campus and Harbor adjacency bonuses as Gold
- **Exodus of the Evangelists:** Missionaries and Apostles gain +2 Movement and +2 charges
- **Hic Sunt Dracones:** +3 Movement for embarked Settlers; bonus Science/Culture from Tribal Villages
- **Reform the Coinage:** +2 Gold from all Trade Routes per turn
- **Heartbeat of Steam:** +10% Industrial Zone bonus toward Wonders; +1 Production from Power Plants
- **Sky and Stars:** +30% Production toward Space projects
- **To Arms!:** Earn Era Score from kills; bonus Production after capturing cities
- **Wish You Were Here:** +100% Tourism from National Parks; +2 Tourism from Seaside Resorts
- **Bodyguard of Lies:** Spies operate 25% faster and start at +1 level
- **Automaton Warfare:** Bonus Production toward Giant Death Robots

### Loyalty System

Every city has a **Loyalty** meter (0-100):
- At 100: Full loyalty (city functions normally)
- At 0: City becomes a **Free City** (independent, hostile to all)
- Free Cities can be captured or may flip to the civilization exerting the most loyalty pressure

#### Loyalty Pressure Sources

| Source | Loyalty Effect |
|--------|---------------|
| Nearby cities (your own) | Positive pressure based on population and distance |
| Nearby cities (other civs) | Negative pressure based on population and distance |
| Governor stationed | +8 Loyalty per turn |
| Government Plaza | +8 Loyalty to its city |
| Age type | +3 (Golden/Heroic) or -3 (Dark) per turn |
| Garrison | +1 to +5 (Zulu get more) |
| Amenity status | Happy cities: +3 Loyalty/turn; Unhappy: -3 |
| Victor Governor (special) | +4 Loyalty to nearby cities |
| Cultural dominance (GS) | +25% pressure from dominant civ's Citizens |
| Bread and Circuses project | Exerts Loyalty pressure on nearby foreign cities |

### Governors

Seven unique Governors, each with a promotion tree (4 promotions each):

| Governor | Title | Focus | Key Abilities |
|----------|-------|-------|---------------|
| Reyna | The Financier | Gold/Economy | Purchase districts with Gold (Contractor); +2 Gold from unimproved features |
| Victor | The Castellan | Military/Defense | +5 CS to garrison city; bonus Loyalty to nearby cities; +4 CS to units within city |
| Amani | The Diplomat | City-States | +2 Envoys when established; can be placed in city-states; Doubles Envoy count |
| Magnus | The Steward | Production/Growth | Settlers don't consume Population; +50% yields from harvesting; Industrial Zone area-of-effect +2 tiles |
| Moksha | The Cardinal | Faith/Religion | Purchase districts with Faith; +2 Spread Religion charges; religious units immune in city |
| Pingala | The Educator | Science/Culture | +15% Science and Culture; +100% Great People points; Space Initiative (+30% Space Production) |
| Liang | The Surveyor | Builder/Improvement | Builders gain +1 charge; Fisheries improvement; builds +30% faster in city |

#### Governor Mechanics
- Earn Governor Titles through civic progression and Government Plaza buildings
- Each title can assign a new Governor or promote an existing one
- Governors must be **established** in a city (takes 5 turns, 3 with certain bonuses)
- A Governor can be **reassigned** to another city (re-establishment required)
- Only one Governor per city

### Emergencies

Triggered by aggressive actions, Emergencies rally other civilizations:

| Trigger | Emergency Type |
|---------|---------------|
| Converting a Holy City | Religious Emergency |
| Using a Nuclear Weapon | Nuclear Emergency |
| Capturing a city-state (GS) | Military Emergency |
| A civ becoming too strong | General Emergency |

#### How Emergencies Work
1. A triggering event occurs
2. Other civilizations vote whether to join the Emergency
3. Participants have a **time limit** to achieve the emergency goal (e.g., liberate the city)
4. **Success:** Participants earn rewards (Gold, Diplomatic Favor, etc.)
5. **Failure:** The target civilization earns rewards instead

## Gathering Storm (February 2019)

### Climate & Natural Disasters

#### Disaster Types

| Disaster | Terrain | Effect |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Volcanic Eruption | Near Volcanoes | Destroys improvements, damages units, but adds Volcanic Soil (+Food, +Production) |
| River Flood | Floodplains | Damages improvements, but fertilizes tiles (+Food) |
| Hurricane | Coast/Ocean | Damages coastal improvements, units, and districts |
| Tornado | Flat land (Plains/Grassland) | Destroys improvements, damages units |
| Drought | Desert, Grassland, Plains | Reduces Food yields temporarily |
| Blizzard | Tundra, Snow | Damages units, reduces yields temporarily |
| Forest Fire (DLC) | Woods, Rainforest | Removes features but adds bonus yields |

#### Disaster Intensity
- Disaster severity can be configured at game setup (0-4 scale)
- Higher intensity = more frequent and destructive disasters
- **Dam** district prevents flood damage on that river
- Some civilizations are immune to certain disasters (Russia: Blizzards; Egypt: Floods)

### Global Warming & Climate Change

#### CO2 Emissions
- **Coal Power Plants** generate CO2 when consuming Coal
- **Oil Power Plants** generate CO2 when consuming Oil
- **Nuclear Power Plants** generate NO CO2
- **Renewable sources** (Solar, Wind, Geothermal, Hydroelectric) generate NO CO2

#### Climate Change Effects
1. **Polar ice melts:** Low-lying coastal tiles are progressively submerged
2. **Sea level rises:** Phase 1, 2, 3 -- each submerges more coast tiles
3. **Increased disasters:** More frequent and severe natural disasters
4. **Deforestation tracking:** Removing Woods/Rainforest contributes to warming

#### Mitigation
- Build **Flood Barriers** (city building) to protect against sea level rise
- Switch to renewable power sources
- **Carbon Recapture** project (Future Era) actively reduces CO2
- **Global Warming Mitigation** civic provides Diplomatic Victory point

### Power System

Late-game buildings (Tier 3 district buildings) require **Power** to function at full capacity:

| Power Source | Building/Improvement | Power Generated | CO2? |
|-------------|---------------------|-----------------|------|
| Coal | Coal Power Plant | 4 Power (6 tile radius) | Yes |
| Oil | Oil Power Plant | 4 Power (6 tile radius) | Yes |
| Nuclear | Nuclear Power Plant | 6 Power (6 tile radius) | No (but risk of meltdown) |
| Solar | Solar Farm (improvement) | 1-2 Power | No |
| Wind | Wind Farm (improvement) | 1-2 Power | No |
| Geothermal | Geothermal Plant (GS) | 4 Power | No |
| Hydroelectric | Dam district + Hydroelectric Dam | 6 Power | No |

#### Unpowered Buildings
Buildings that need Power but don't have it still function but at reduced output
(they lose their bonus yields that require Power).

### World Congress

A periodic gathering of all civilizations to vote on resolutions:

#### Sessions
- World Congress meets at regular intervals (approximately every 30 turns on Standard)
- **Special Sessions** can be called for emergencies

#### Resolutions
Players spend **Diplomatic Favor** to vote on resolutions:
- **Luxury Ban:** Ban a luxury resource (removes Amenities from all players)
- **Military Advisory:** Bonus or penalty to certain unit types
- **Trade Policy:** Modify Trade Route yields
- **Heritage Organization:** Bonus/penalty to certain Great Work types
- **Arms Control:** Limit certain military activities
- **World Leader Election:** Vote for a player to gain/lose 2 Diplomatic Victory Points

#### Diplomatic Favor Sources
| Source | Favor per Turn |
|--------|---------------|
| Per city-state suzerainty | +1 |
| Per alliance | +1 |
| Government type | Varies (Democracy: highest) |
| Certain wonders | Varies |
| Canada ability | From Tourism |
| America ability (GS) | +1 per Wildcard slot |

### Diplomatic Victory

New victory condition requiring **20 Diplomatic Victory Points**. (See victory_conditions.md for full details.)

### Strategic Resources (Revamped)

In Gathering Storm, strategic resources work differently:
- Resources are **accumulated** per turn into a stockpile (not binary access)
- Units require per-turn maintenance (consume resources each turn)
- Stockpile has a maximum capacity (increased by certain buildings)
- Running low on resources causes **combat penalties** for affected units
- Resources can be traded (both stockpile amounts and per-turn income)
- **Encampment** and **Harbor** buildings increase stockpile limits

### Engineering Districts

Two new districts added:
- **Dam:** Built on Floodplains. Prevents flood damage. Enables Hydroelectric Dam.
- **Canal:** Connects water bodies or City Center to water. Allows naval passage through land.

Both are non-specialty (no Population requirement) and can be rushed by Military Engineers.

### World Era vs Individual Era (Rise & Fall Change)

In Rise & Fall, era progression for warmonger penalties uses the **individual** civilization's
era, not the global World Era. This means a civilization in the Ancient Era while others
are in the Medieval Era still gets Ancient Era warmonger scaling.

### Scored Competitions (Gathering Storm)

In addition to Emergencies, Gathering Storm adds **Scored Competitions**:

| Competition | Scoring Criteria | Rewards |
|------------|-----------------|---------|
| World Games | Entertainment/Sports buildings | Tourism bonuses |
| International Space Station | Space Race projects | Science bonuses, spacecraft speed |
| Nobel Prize (with Sweden) | Various (Science, Literature, Peace) | Great People, Diplomatic Favor |
| Military Aid Request | Sending military support | Diplomatic Victory Points |
| Aid Request | Sending Gold/resources to disaster victims | Diplomatic Victory Points |

### Rock Bands (Gathering Storm)

- Purchased with Faith after researching **Cold War** civic
- Travel to other civilizations and perform concerts
- Each performance generates a burst of **Tourism** against the target civilization
- Rock Bands have random promotions affecting where they perform and their effectiveness
- Rock Bands have a chance of disbanding after each performance (higher level = more risky)
- Excellent for targeted Tourism pushes in Culture Victory

### Future Era

Gathering Storm adds a full **Future Era** with:
- Repeatable **Future Tech** and **Future Civic** research
- Tier 5 governments (Corporate Libertarianism, Digital Democracy, Synthetic Technocracy)
- **Giant Death Robot** unit (strongest unit in the game, CS 130)
- Future Era technologies and civics that provide Victory Points and bonuses
- **Carbon Recapture** project to combat climate change
